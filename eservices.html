        <h1>Managed Elections</h1>
        <p>
          If you require an independent firm to run your entire voting event or
          if you prefer full service project management, our managed election
          service is your solution. Simply Voting staff are professional online
          voting experts and have developed best practices specific to each
          industry. You can sit back and relax knowing that your election is
          being completely managed by a neutral party that specializes in online
          voting.
        </p>
        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <p>
          Simply Voting will assign a dedicated election consultant to fully
          manage your voting event. This primary point of contact will work
          closely with you to ensure that your election is successful and meets
          your objectives. After an initial interview the consultant will put
          together a project plan that outlines requirements, tasks and
          deadlines.
          <br />
          <br />
          Simply Voting staff will then set up the voting system according to
          the specifications provided. This generally includes branding the
          voting website, ballot creation, and preparation of the list of
          electors. Depending on your requirements, we may also generate unique
          passwords for each elector, integrate with your organization's
          existing authentication method, or schedule mass-emails containing
          personalized voting instructions and reminders to vote.
          <br /><br />
          If a mass-mailing is required, Simply Voting will print a letter
          containing the voter's address, your logo, and personalized voting
          instructions for online voting. The letter is folded and inserted
          inside a high-security window envelope, then sent via USPS as First
          Class Mail or via Canada Post as lettermail. Your personnel will never
          have access to voter passwords and the integrity of your election is
          safeguarded.
          <br /><br />
          Your election consultant will always provide previews of the online
          ballot and any communication materials for your feedback and approval.
          <br /><br />
          During the election, Simply Voting staff will actively monitor the
          election to ensure that everything is working as intended. The
          consultant will handle day-to-day election administration and report
          on mid-election turnout. Following the election, the consultant will
          deliver the voting results, an audit trail, as well as any other
          reports required
